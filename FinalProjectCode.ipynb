      "\n",
      "1. **Spelling and Grammar**: Your resume is free from spelling and grammatical errors. Good job!\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Clarity of Writing**: The writing in your resume is clear and understandable. However, you could improve the clarity of your work experience descriptions by using more specific action verbs. For example, instead of saying \"Assisted manager in carrying out the day-to-day activities\", you could say \"Collaborated with the manager to execute daily operations\".\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Job Experience Timeline**: Your work experience is within the last three years, which is good. However, you should consider adding more recent experiences related to the job you're applying for, such as internships or projects in computer science or business administration.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Use of Metrics**: You have quantified your achievements in your work experience, such as \"Increased sales by approximately 80%\". This is excellent as it gives a clear picture of your impact.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Use of Personal Pronouns**: Your resume does not use personal pronouns, which is good as it maintains a professional tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Consistent Formatting**: Your resume has consistent formatting. However, there are some unnecessary spaces and lines that could be removed to make it look cleaner and more professional.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Bullet Points**: You have more than three bullet points under your work experience at ASAKOTS Ventures. Try to limit it to three key achievements or responsibilities to make it more concise.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Job Requirements**: The job you're applying for requires skills in computing, communication, and writing. While you have mentioned some of these skills, you could highlight them more prominently. For example, you could add a section for \"Key Skills\" and list these skills there.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Relevant Coursework**: You have listed relevant coursework in your education section. However, you could consider adding more courses related to business administration or management information systems, as these are majors wanted by the job.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Special Skills**: The job requires proficiency in internal software systems. If you have experience with any specific software systems, be sure to include them in your \"Technical Skills\" section.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. **Other Requirements**: The job requires tasks such as attending meetings, performing research, updating social media platforms, and creating images for social media posts. If you have experience with these tasks, be sure to include them in your work experience or skills section.\n"
