This summary should briefly outline the user's skills, experiences, and career goals. For example, \"Computer Science student with a strong background in Python and Java, seeking an internship opportunity to apply my technical skills and gain practical experience.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Verify correct and effective grammar usage: The CV seems to have correct grammar usage. However, it's recommended to use a grammar checking tool to ensure there are no unnoticed errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Restrict job experiences to those within the last three years from the current date: The user has included experiences from the last three years. However, the user should ensure to update the CV regularly to keep the experiences within the three-year range.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Tailor the CV to align with the requirements of the target position: The user should tailor the CV to match the internship requirements. For example, the user can highlight their proficiency in Python and familiarity with Java and Prolog under the 'Technical Skills' section, as the job requires computing skills. The user can also emphasize their communication and writing skills under the 'Skills' section.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Quantify achievements with numerical data: The user has quantified some achievements, such as increasing sales by 80%. However, the user can further quantify their achievements in other roles. For example, \"Managed and organized meal times for over 200 students during the global pandemic.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Include the user's full name, email, contact number, and address in the CV: The user has included all the necessary contact information.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Avoid personal pronouns in the CV: The user has avoided using personal pronouns in the CV.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Maintain consistent formatting throughout the document: The user has maintained consistent formatting throughout the CV. However, the user can improve the CV's appearance by using bullet points for the 'Skills' section, similar to the 'Technical Skills' section.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Each experience should have at least 3 bullet points: The user has included at least three bullet points for each experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Incorporate Action verbs in the CV: The user has incorporated action verbs in the CV. However, the user can use more powerful action verbs. For example, instead of \"Assisted manager,\" the user can say \"Collaborated with the manager.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Other Recommendations:\n",

      "- The user can include a 'Projects' section to showcase any relevant projects they have completed during their course. This can demonstrate their practical skills and knowledge.\n",
      "- The user can also include a 'References' section at the end of the CV, if they have any references from their previous roles or from their professors.\n",
